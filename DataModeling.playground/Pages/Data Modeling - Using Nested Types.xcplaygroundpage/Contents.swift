/*
 Continuing with the idea that we are making an app for a restaurant, let's assume we need to add a feature that "says" the name of every topping back to the user to make sure they are all what the user wants.


 1. Copy and paste the Burrito and Topping structs you made in the previous assignment if you haven't already.
 2. Make a function called readToppings(for burrito: Burrito). This function should loop through each topping of the burrito that was passed in to the function and print out the name of that topping.
 3. Initialize a Burrito in a constant and add a few toppings to it.
 4. Test your function by calling it and passing in the burrito you made in step 3. You should see each topping's name printed in the console.
