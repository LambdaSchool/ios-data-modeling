 Assume we are making an app for a restaurant. Your job is to make a model object to represent a burrito and all of its various toppings.

 1 - Create a struct called `Burrito`. Add a property for its name.
 
 2 - Create a second struct called `Topping` that has property for the topping's name and amount.
 
 3 - Back in the `Burrito` struct, create a variable called toppings whose type is an array of `Topping` objects.

 **You will need these structs for the next assignment. Please copy them so you can paste them into the next assignment's code editor.**
